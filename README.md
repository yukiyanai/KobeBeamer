**Yuki Yanai**, Assistant Professor, *Graduate School of Law, Kobe University*

This is an *unofficial* Beamer theme for Kobe University.

![Example](examples/example-BeamerKobe.jpg)

## Update

Version 0.02 was uploaded 04/20/2015.

- The alignment of frame title was fixed.
- New option **jp**, which shows the Japanese version of the unversity logo on the title page, was added (You need to download the logo yourself in order to use this option. See **Kobe University Logo** section below).

## Installation

Download this direcotry by clicking **Download ZIP** button on the right.

Unzip the downloaded file, and move it to the directory where you keep LaTeX style files or Beamer theme files. In my environment, it is:

```
~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/
```

A Mac user's default directory should be something like:

```
/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf/tex/latex/
```

A Windows user's default should be something like:

```
C:\localtexmf\tex\latex\beamer\themes\
```

Once you put the KobeBeamer folder in the appropriate directory, type in the terminal:

```
sudo mktexlsr
```

## Usage

Add the following line to the preamble:

```
\usetheme{Kobe}
```

Currently, four options are available.

1. nonav: suppress the navgaition bar
2. nologo: does not show the university logo mark
3. simplefoot: only the slide number is displayed in footer
4. jp: use the Japanese version of the university logo on the title page instaed of the English one.

To use these options, write in the preamble

```
\usetheme[nonav]{Kobe}
```

or

```
\usetheme[nologo]{Kobe}
```

or

```
\usetheme[nonav,simplefoot,jp]{Kobe}
```
etc.

Please use **nologo** option if you have not obtained the logo files yourself from the [Kobe University's official website](http://www.kobe-u.ac.jp) (see **Kobe University Logo** below).


## Color Themes

At the moment, two color themes are available.

#### Theme 1: uribo

This color theme is distributed as [beamercolorthemeuribo.sty](beamercolorthemeuribo.sty).
It uses four officially defined school colors: Kobe-Brick (RGB: 196, 0, 0), Kobe-Green (23, 131, 46), Kobe-Blue (14, 47, 146), and Kobe-Gray (77,77, 77).

This is the default color theme for Kobe Beamer.

To use this color theme with another Beamer theme, write in the preamble:

```
\usecolortheme{uribo}  
```

#### Theme 2: uriboBlack

This color theme is distributed as [beamercolorthemeuriboBlack.sty](beamercolorthemeuriboBlack.sty).

To use this color theme, write in the preamble:

```
\usecolortheme{uriboBlack}  
```
